Neuronav SLAM SDK is a Python library that makes SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) accessible to everyone. We handle the complexity of ROS2, sensor drivers, and SLAM algorithms so you can focus on building your application.

## 2-Line Simplicity

## Traditional SLAM vs Neuronav SDK

| Traditional SLAM | Neuronav SDK |
|------------------|--------------|
| Install and configure ROS2 ❌ | Install SDK ✅ |
| Set up camera drivers ❌ | Run 2 lines of code ✅ |
| Configure SLAM parameters ❌ | |
| Handle topic remapping ❌ | |
| Manage process lifecycle ❌ | |
| **Time to first map: Days** | **Time to first map: 2 minutes** |

## Use Cases

- **Autonomous Navigation** - Mobile robots that need to map and navigate
- **Drone Mapping** - Create 3D maps of buildings and environments
- **AR/VR Tracking** - Track headset position in 3D space
- **3D Reconstruction** - Scan objects and environments
- **Research** - Quickly prototype SLAM applications

## Supported Hardware

**Depth Cameras**
- Intel RealSense D435i, D455, D415
- Luxonis OAK-D Pro, OAK-D Pro W
- [Add your own sensor](/sensors/custom-sensors) in under 20 minutes

**Computing Platforms**
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04
- Docker containers
