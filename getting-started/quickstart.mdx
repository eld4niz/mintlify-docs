Get your first SLAM system running in 2 minutes with just 2 lines of Python code.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 (or Windows 11 with WSL2)
- Python 3.8+
- Intel RealSense or OAK-D Pro camera
- SDK installed ([see installation guide](/getting-started/installation))

## Your First SLAM Application

**1. Create a new Python file**

```bash
touch my_first_slam.py
```

**2. Add these 2 lines**

```python
from neuronav import RealSenseSensor, run_slam, RTABMapSLAM

sensor = RealSenseSensor()
run_slam(sensor, RTABMapSLAM())
```

**3. Run it**

```bash
python3 my_first_slam.py
```

That's it! Your robot is now creating a 3D map in real-time.

## With 3D Visualization

Add `visualize=True` to see the map being built:

```python
from neuronav import RealSenseSensor, run_slam, RTABMapSLAM

sensor = RealSenseSensor()
run_slam(sensor, RTABMapSLAM(), visualize=True)
```

Open http://localhost:8765 in your browser to view the live 3D map.

## Using OAK-D Pro Camera

Simply change the sensor:

```python
from neuronav import OAKDSensor, run_slam, RTABMapSLAM

sensor = OAKDSensor()
run_slam(sensor, RTABMapSLAM())
```
